# STM32 Component Setup Recipes

## About
This repository provides a collection of examples for setting up various **STM32** components using **bare-metal**, **CMSIS**, and **HAL** frameworks. The examples are tailored for the **STM32L4** series, specifically using the **B-L4S5I-IOT01A Discovery Board**.

**ðŸš€ Features:**

- âœ… **Multi-architecture Docker support** (ARM64 Mac + x86_64 CI/CD)
- âœ… **Complete CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- âœ… **VS Code integration** with comprehensive tasks and debugging
- âœ… **Automated notifications** (GitHub Issues, PR comments, build artifacts)
- âœ… **Consistent development environment** across local and cloud builds

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started with a consistent, pre-configured environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stm32-recipes.git
cd stm32-recipes

# Start development container (downloads multi-arch image automatically)
./start-dev-container.sh

# Inside container: Setup dependencies and build
./thirdparty.sh
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build .
```

### Option 2: Local Development

For local development with your own ARM toolchain:

```bash
# Install dependencies
# - ARM GNU Toolchain: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads
# - CMake 3.15+

# Setup and build
./thirdparty.sh
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build .
```

## Development Environment

### Docker-Based Development

This repository includes a **multi-architecture Docker image** (`dsavvari/stm32-dev:latest`) that works on:

- **ARM64 Macs** (Apple Silicon)
- **x86_64 Linux** (GitHub Actions, Intel/AMD)

#### Container Management

```bash
# Start/attach to development container
./start-dev-container.sh

# The script automatically:
# - Creates container if it doesn't exist
# - Starts container if stopped
# - Attaches to running container
```

#### Docker Image Management

```bash
# Build and push multi-architecture image (maintainers only)
./build-and-push-docker.sh

# Or push existing local image
./push-docker-image.sh
```

### Local Development Requirements

If not using Docker, ensure you have:

- **ARM Toolchain**: [ARM GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
- **CMake 3.15+**: For build system
- **Git**: For dependency management

## Project Structure

### Example Folders

Each example is located in its own directory with a complete `CMakeLists.txt` file, making it easy to build and deploy independently.

#### `bareMetalBlink`

- A minimal **bare-metal** implementation of a "Blink LED" program. This example demonstrates how to set up basic GPIO for an LED blink with no external libraries (other than the necessary CMSIS).

#### `bareMetalPWM`

- A bare-metal example demonstrating **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** signal generation on STM32L4S5VI (B-L4S5I-IOT01A). This example configures TIM2 to output a PWM signal on PA0 (ARD-D1), and allows the user to cycle through preset frequencies or pulse widths by pressing the user button (PC13). All configuration is done via direct register access, without HAL or CMSIS drivers. This is ideal for learning low-level STM32 timer and GPIO control.

#### `bareMetalSysTick`

- A bare-metal example demonstrating **SysTick timer** implementation on STM32L4S5VI (B-L4S5I-IOT01A). This example configures the SysTick timer for precise timing control and demonstrates synchronous LED blinking on three outputs: PA5 (LED1), PB14 (LED2), and PA0 (external LED/oscilloscope probe). The user can cycle through different blink frequencies (1000/500/300/250/200ms) by pressing the user button (PC13). All configuration is done via direct register access using CMSIS, making it ideal for learning low-level STM32 timing and interrupt handling.

#### `TBA`

- **To Be Added**: Future examples will be added to demonstrate other STM32L4 features such as UART, I2C, DMA, FLASH, etc.

## VS Code Integration

This project includes comprehensive VS Code tasks and launch configurations for seamless development in both environments:

### Dual Environment Support

The VS Code tasks are designed to work in two environments:

1. **Inside Docker Container**: When VS Code is running inside the Docker container (e.g., via Remote-Containers extension), use the standard tasks without "(Docker)" suffix.
2. **On Host System**: When VS Code is running on the host system, use the tasks with "(Docker)" suffix to execute commands inside the container.

### Build Tasks

**Standard Tasks (use inside Docker container or with local ARM toolchain):**

- **Build All Projects**: Build all STM32 projects (default build task)
- **Build Project**: Build a specific project (with dropdown selection)
- **Clean Build**: Clean all build artifacts
- **Configure CMake**: Configure CMake for Debug build
- **Initial Project Setup**: Complete setup including dependencies and CMake configuration
- **Setup Dependencies**: Setup third-party dependencies (STM32-CMake, STM32CubeL4)

**Docker Tasks (use from host system):**

- **Build All Projects (Docker)**: Build all STM32 projects inside Docker container
- **Build Project (Docker)**: Build a specific project inside Docker container
- **Clean Build (Docker)**: Clean build artifacts inside Docker container
- **Configure CMake (Docker)**: Configure CMake inside Docker container
- **Initial Project Setup (Docker)**: Complete setup inside Docker container
- **Setup Dependencies (Docker)**: Setup dependencies inside Docker container

### Hardware Tasks (Always run on Host)

- **Start OpenOCD Server**: Start OpenOCD server for STM32 debugging (requires OpenOCD installed on host)
- **Flash STM32**: Flash a binary to STM32 using OpenOCD (with project selection)

### Debug Configuration

- **GDB Debug STM32**: Generic debug configuration with project selection dropdown

**Note**: Hardware access tasks (OpenOCD, flashing, debugging) must always run on the host system where the ST-Link debugger is physically connected, regardless of whether the build environment is inside Docker or local.

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

# Inside container: Build projects
cd build
cmake --build . --target stm32l4-bareMetalBlink

# Or build all projects
cmake --build .
```

#### **For Contributors/Maintainers:**

```bash
# Update Docker image (after Dockerfile changes)
./build-and-push-docker.sh

# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
git push  # Triggers CI/CD automatically
```

#### **VS Code Integration:**

- Open repository in VS Code
- Use Command Palette: "Tasks: Run Task"
- Available tasks:
  - **Docker tasks**: For host-based development
  - **Standard tasks**: For container-based development
  - **Hardware tasks**: For debugging and flashing (host only)

### ðŸ›  **Local CI Testing**

Test CI behavior locally using the same Docker environment:

```bash
# Use the same image as CI/CD
./start-dev-container.sh

# Run the same build steps as CI
./thirdparty.sh
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
         -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../repos/stm32-cmake/cmake/stm32_gcc.cmake \
         -DSTM32_CHIP=STM32L4S5VI
cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)

# Check binary sizes like CI does
for project in bareMetalBlink bareMetalPWM bareMetalSysTick; do
  if [ -f "${project}/stm32l4-${project}.elf" ]; then
    arm-none-eabi-size "${project}/stm32l4-${project}.elf"
  fi
done
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**Problem**: `Error response from daemon: pull access denied`
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into Docker Hub: `docker login`

**Problem**: `Multi-platform build is not supported for the docker driver`
**Solution**: The build script automatically creates a proper buildx builder. If issues persist, run:
```bash
docker buildx create --name stm32-builder --use --bootstrap
```

**Problem**: Container startup issues

**Solution**:

```bash
# Clean up and restart
docker stop dev_stm32
docker rm dev_stm32
./start-dev-container.sh
```

### Build Issues

**Problem**: `arm-none-eabi-gcc: command not found`

**Solution**:

- If using Docker: Ensure you're in the container (`./start-dev-container.sh`)
- If local: Install ARM GNU Toolchain and ensure it's in PATH

**Problem**: CMake configuration fails

**Solution**:

```bash
# Clean and reconfigure
rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

**Problem**: Third-party dependencies missing

**Solution**:

```bash
# Re-run dependency setup
./thirdparty.sh
```

### CI/CD Issues

**Problem**: GitHub Actions failing with shell errors
**Solution**: The workflow uses POSIX-compliant shell syntax. Avoid bash-specific operators like `==` in shell scripts.

**Problem**: Docker image pull failures in CI
**Solution**: Ensure the Docker image `dsavvari/stm32-dev:latest` exists and is public on Docker Hub.
